WHAT EMULATES RIGHT IN FBZX WII?

-Screen timmings in 48K and 128K mode.
-Screen generation, so border efects and even attribute changing efects
    should work fine.
-48K sound
-128K sound (fully emulation of the AY-3-8912).
-Trash in the bus when reading from a non-existing port. This is right generated
    (from the data being displayed in that moment) so games works right (like
    SHORTCIRCUIT, that runs without flickering).

-Priority of joystick over keyboard.
-Snow efect when I register points between 64 and 127.
