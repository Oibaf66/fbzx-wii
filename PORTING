HOW TO PORT FBZX INTO OTHER O.S. AND ARQUITECTURES

FBZX uses the SDL library, so you must have it available in the
arquitecture/operating system where you want to port it. It's the only 'must
have'. Of course, is possible that you have to rewrite the Makefile, but that's
relatively easy (isn't it?).

The sound system is designed to be easily portable; currently it supports both
the OSS and ALSA arquitecture. In the file 'sound.c' are defined the three
functions needed to support it:

    sound_init: initializates the sound system with the desired sound format,
    speed, and so on, and fills the 'ordenador' struct with the parameters
    needed to sincronize the emulation.
	
    sound_play: plays the current sound buffer, and initializates
    'ordenador.current_buffer' to the new buffer to be filled. It must not
    return until the buffer has been played (this allows the sincronization).

    sound_close: closes the sound device and frees all memory used.

That's all. Start to compile :)
