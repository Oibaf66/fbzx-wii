FBZX-GC

USAGE
------
Put .z80 and .sna files in /fbzx-gc/snapshots or .tap and .tzx files in /fbzx-gc/tapes on your SD card.

Press the "start" button to access the in-game menu. Press X or A to select an item and Y or B to come back to the previous menu.

Press the "R" button to access the virtual keyboard.

The in-game menu allows you to insert tapes, load them and configure the display, joysticks etc.

The easiest way to play a game is to load a snapshot (.z80 and .sna files).

You can also insert a tape file (.tap and .tzx) and then load the file in the tape menu (it simulates the command Load "").
 
If you have problems with a file loading, likely the file has a program which uses a custom routine to load the blocks; in this case, try to disable the "Instant load" option.
 
If you want to speed up the tape file loading (both for .tzx file and .tap file with "tap instant load" disabled), try to enable "auto turbo mode" which speeds up the emulator while loading.

It is possible to set precision emulation required by some demo graphic programs but Gamecube is not enough powerful to support it unless you set 320X240 resolution. 

The general preferences are saved (joystick type, machine, buttons bindings, etc.) from the main in-game menu and they are loaded on start-up.

You can also save the game preferences which can be automatically loaded with the tape/snapshot if the related option is set.

If you save the screen shots they will appear on the screen during the menu navigation.

If Rumble is enabled, the controller rumbles each time the fire button is pressed.
