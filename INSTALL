HOW TO INSTALL FBZX

If you want to install FBZX, you must compile your own version,
just typing as root:

	make clean
	make
	make install

Be sure you have the SDL, libasound2 and libpulse libraries (both runtime and
headers).


HOW TO RUN FBZX

Just type

	fbzx

If you don't want sound (or you haven't a sound card), you can run it with

	fbzx -nosound

To know all the other FBZX options, just type

	fbzx -h

or

	fbzx --help

and enjoy!
