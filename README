FBZX Wii

A ZX Spectrum emulator for Wii.

The project is based on FBZX originally written by Sergio Costas http://www.rastersoft.com/fbzx.html.
The code has been ported to Wii and largely improved with many new features by Oibaf (Fabio Olimpieri).

FBZX Wii can be found on Github at github.com/Oibaf66/fbzx-wii.
 
There is also a gamecube port.

The program uses the SDL Wii library.

The old exception for the Z80 emulator has been removed because now FBZX uses
