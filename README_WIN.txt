FBZX Wii was written to run on WII, for testing purpose FBZX Wii was adapted
to run also on Windows. Even if some WII features cannot be used (i.e. rumble),
the emulator is fully usable.

These are the basic instructions:

fbzx-wii.exe starts the program with the default configurations.
fbzx-wii.exe -h for help
fbzx-wii.exe -turbo3 -fs -db -hw for full screen and very fast tape loading.

You can try with higher values for turbo until you hear cracked sound.

The wiimote pointer is emulated by the mouse pointer.

FBZX Wii has two GUIs: one is derived from the original FBZX and the other one is Wii specific.
